            <b>Selling Ground Support Equipment</b>
            <div class="mrgLeftAndBtmTxt">
                This Website is a listing service for Ground Support Equipment that brings together buyers
                and sellers worldwide. Information about a particular item for sale is supplied
                by the seller, not by the Company. The price and other terms of any sale remain
                subject to direct negotiation between the buyer and the seller. We cannot assure
                the seller of Equipment that the payment he/she gets from the buyer isn't going
                to bounce. When using this Website to find a buyer for your Equipment we urge you
                to use the same common sense and good judgment you would use in selling your Equipment
                through other forms of classified ads.
                <br />
                <br />
                In connection with our efforts to combat Internet fraud, some listings may be screened
                before being posted publicly. This process may delay display of your listing. If
                it appears that your email message has not reached the seller of the Equipment you're
                inquiring about, you might try inquiring by telephone if the seller has provided
                a telephone number. The Company does not control, route or manage emails.<br />
                <br />
                <ol>
                    <li>When you offer a Equipment for sale through the Website, you must be prepared to
                        you’re your Equipment at the price at which, and on the terms which you've listed
                        it. </li>
                    <li>You must have possession and legal ownership of the actual ground support equipment
                     and the ability to transfer title. </li>
                    <li>In order to list Equipment for sale on the Website, sellers are required to provide
                        certain identifying and contact information. The information must accurately identify
                        the seller and the method of contact must permit buyers to communicate directly
                        with the seller. </li>
                    <li>You may not charge any potential buyer for information about any ground support equipment
                     listed for sale on the Website, nor may you use our Website to promote,
                        without our prior written permission, any other website, product or service. </li>
                    <li>Adverts are available only to sellers who want to list their Equipment for sale.
                        These adverts are not to be used to advertise more than one piece of Equipment per
                        ad purchased, regardless of ad duration. </li>
                    <li>For this reason, you cannot edit your Equipment adverts’ year, make, model or registration
                        number once you've purchased your ad. Always double-check this information before
                        submitting your ad.</li>
                    <li>The Company reserves the right to deny use of this website to anyone who does not
                        comply with these requirements or who otherwise uses our website in a manner we
                        consider inappropriate.</li>
                    <li>The Website offers a variety of ad packages, with combinations of features that
                        vary by market area. </li>
                    <li>For information about the ad packages available to sellers in your area, click the
                        &quot;Sell Your Equipment&quot; tab or button on our home page. Then view our product
                        offerings. </li>
                    <li>Responsibility for the information contained in each listing lies with each seller.
                        You alone are responsible for material you post and for the content of all email
                        messages transmitted through the Website. Nothing will undermine a user's confidence
                        in the Equipment you wish to sell faster than inaccurate statements or misleading
                        representations about the items. And since any erosion of user confidence in you
                        is likely to be accompanied by erosion of user confidence in us, we will want to
                        ensure that the information you supply is accurate and that, in all respects, you
                        treat Website users fairly and honourably.</li>
                    <li>Though we can't monitor every transaction that originates through a listing on the
                        Website, we may perform random quality assurance tests to confirm that those who
                        offer Equipment for sale through the Website are prepared to sell the Equipment
                        they advertise at the prices at which, and the terms on which, they advertise them.
                    </li>
                    <li>By using our service to sell your Equipment, you agree to cooperate in these random
                        quality assurance tests. If our tests reveal, or we otherwise learn, that a seller
                        is engaging in &quot;bait and switch&quot; or other unfair or deceptive practices,
                        the Company reserves the right to deny that seller use of the service to sell his/her
                        Equipment</li>
                    <li>By placing an ad through our Website service to sell your Equipment, you agree to
                        pay the fees specified for the package you select, regardless of whether your Equipment
                        sell as a result of the listing.</li>
                    <li>Take care in selecting your ad package and inputting your ad information; listing
                        fees are generally not refundable, even if you provide erroneous information or
                        fail to sell your Equipment.</li>
                    <li>Our secondhand Equipment listings include items that have been &quot;certified&quot;
                        as meeting certain standards established by manufacturers and/or dealers in connection
                        with their secondhand vehicle programs. The decision to certify any particular Equipment
                        is made by the certifying manufacturer or dealer, and the information included in
                        the Website’s Equipment listings are provided by the listing dealer. </li>
                    <li>Neither the Company nor the manufacturer is responsible for the accuracy of any
                        information supplied in relation to certified Equipment listed; only the manufacturer
                        or the dealer who certifies Equipment is responsible for the decision to certify
                        Equipment. </li>
                    <li>You should familiarise yourself with the terms of any applicable certification program
                        before buying a certified piece of Equipment.</li>
                    <li>The Website is an online advertising resource. The online ads you purchase on the

                        If you choose to purchase an inspection through such a third-party website, remember
                        that an inspection is not a warranty. Although inspections can be of significant
                        value in the purchase of a secondhand Equipment, an inspection is not a guarantee
                        that the inspected Equipment is free from defects or that the inspectors have identified
                        all existing defects. Before you purchase inspection services, you should confirm
                        with the inspector the location at which the inspection will be conducted, the scope
                        and price of the inspection, and any other information you consider important to
                        your decision. You are responsible for coordinating and arranging for the inspection.
                        You release the Company and its affiliates from any damages that you may incur,
                        and agree not to assert any claims against them, arising from your purchase or use
                        of third-party supplied products and services.</li>
